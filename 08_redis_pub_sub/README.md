# Network Telemetry with Redis Pub/Sub

This project demonstrates a simple network telemetry system using Redis as a Pub/Sub mechanism. The code within `main.go` contains both a publisher and a subscriber connected to Redis. We simulate network telemetry events by sending data to the publisher, which then determines if an alert should be triggered based on certain conditions. If the conditions are met, the subscriber will log and alert accordingly.

## Running the Project

Before running the main application, ensure you have Redis running. You can easily spin up a Redis instance using Docker:

```bash
docker run --name some-redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

In a seperate terminal window we need to do `go run main.go` to initialize our pub/sub app

```

```


Next open up a terminal window and send the following CURL to the gateway on `:8080`
This is some JSON body which has some logic inside the publisher based upon the thresehold for the Packet count. If the thresehold is breached then we will send to Redis and the subscriber will pick up the message and alert and log it.

```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/telemetry-data \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "hostname": "dc-router-1",
    "interface": "GigabitEthernet0/1/0",
    "input_errors": 1533300
}'
```
All being well then you should see the alert and log messages being generated
```
