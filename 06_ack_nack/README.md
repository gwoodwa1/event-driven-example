# Acknowledgment (`Ack`) and Negative Acknowledgment (`Nack`)

## Concepts:

When dealing with message-driven systems, ensuring that a message has been successfully processed is crucial. This is where acknowledgments come into play.

1. **Acknowledgment (`Ack`)**:
   - An acknowledgment (`Ack`) is a signal sent by a subscriber to indicate that a message has been successfully received and processed.
   - Once a message is acknowledged, the message broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) knows that it doesn't need to redeliver that message to the subscriber.

2. **Negative Acknowledgment (`Nack`)**:
   - A negative acknowledgment (`Nack`) is the opposite of an `Ack`. It indicates that there was a problem processing the message.
   - Reasons for sending a `Nack` might include:
     - Message payload is malformed or cannot be parsed.
     - An error occurred while processing the message, such as a database error.
     - The processing logic determined that the message should not be processed (e.g., an invalid command in a command-driven system).

3. **Handling `Nack`**:
   - When a message broker receives a `Nack`, it knows that the message was not processed successfully.
   - Depending on the broker and its configuration, several actions can be taken:
     - **Immediate Redelivery**: The broker might immediately try to redeliver the message.
     - **Delayed Redelivery**: The broker might wait for a specified period before attempting to redeliver.
     - **Dead Letter Queue**: After a certain number of redelivery attempts, the message might be moved to a special queue called a "dead letter queue" for further inspection.

## Practical Considerations:

1. **Idempotency**:
   - Ensure that message processing is idempotent. This means that processing a message more than once should have the same effect as processing it once. This is crucial because if a subscriber sends a `Nack`, the message might be redelivered and processed again.

2. **Retry Strategy**:
   - Decide on a retry strategy. For example, after how many failed attempts should you stop trying to process a message? This can prevent a system from being bogged down by repeatedly trying to process problematic messages.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Monitor the rate of `Nack` messages. A sudden spike might indicate a problem with the system.
   - Set up alerts for high rates of `Nack` messages or for messages that end up in the dead letter queue.

## Code Example:

```go
for msg := range messages {
    err := processMessage(msg)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error processing message:", err)
        msg.Nack()  // Signal that the message was not processed successfully
        continue
    }
    msg.Ack()  // Signal that the message was processed successfully
}
```
# Futher explaination comparing Message Brokers vs. TCP Handshake process

## Message Brokers (`Ack` and `Nack`):

In message-driven systems:

- **Ack (Acknowledgment)**:
  - Indicates that a message has been successfully received and processed.
  - Tells the message broker that it doesn't need to redeliver that message.

- **Nack (Negative Acknowledgment)**:
  - Indicates a problem in processing the message.
  - Signals the broker to potentially redeliver the message or take other actions.

## TCP Handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK):

In the TCP protocol, establishing a connection involves a three-way handshake:

1. **SYN (Synchronize)**:
   - Sent by the client to initiate a connection.
   - Analogous to a `Nack` in message brokers, as it indicates the need to establish or re-establish a connection.

2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)**:
   - Sent by the server in response to a SYN from the client.
   - Indicates the server's acknowledgment of the connection request.

3. **ACK (Acknowledgment)**:
   - Sent by the client in response to SYN-ACK from the server.
   - Confirms the establishment of a connection.
   - Analogous to an `Ack` in message brokers, as it confirms successful receipt and processing.

## Relating the Two:

- Just as a `Nack` in message brokers might lead to a message being redelivered, a `SYN` in TCP might lead to re-attempts to establish a connection.
  
- An `Ack` in both contexts indicates successful processing or establishment. In message brokers, it's about successful message processing, while in TCP, it's about successful connection establishment.

- In both systems, the acknowledgment mechanisms ensure reliability. In message brokers, it ensures that messages are processed. In TCP, it ensures that data is reliably transmitted between client and server.
